  "readme": "# express-mysql-session [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chill117/express-mysql-session.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chill117/express-mysql-session)\n\nA MySQL session store for express.js\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd to your application via `npm`:\n```\nnpm install express-mysql-session --save\n```\nThis will install `express-mysql-session` and add it to your application's `package.json` file.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use `express-mysql-session`, simply use it with your express session middleware, like this:\n```js\nvar express = require('express')\nvar app = module.exports = express()\n\nvar SessionStore = require('express-mysql-session')\n\napp.configure(function() {\n\n\tvar options = {\n\t\thost: 'localhost',\n\t\tport: 3306,\n\t\tuser: 'session_test',\n\t\tpassword: 'password',\n\t\tdatabase: 'session_test'\n\t}\n\n\tapp.use(express.session({\n\t\tkey: 'session_cookie_name',\n\t\tsecret: 'session_cookie_secret',\n\t\tstore: new SessionStore(options)\n\t}))\n\n})\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere are a number of ways you can contribute:\n\n* **Improve or correct the documentation** - All the documentation is in this `readme.md` file. If you see a mistake, or think something should be clarified or expanded upon, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chill117/express-mysql-session/pulls/new)\n* **Report a bug** - Please review [existing issues](https://github.com/chill117/express-mysql-session/issues) before submitting a new one; to avoid duplicates. If you can't find an issue that relates to the bug you've found, please [create a new one](https://github.com/chill117/express-mysql-session/issues).\n* **Fix a bug** - Have a look at the [existing issues](https://github.com/chill117/express-mysql-session/issues) for the project. If there's a bug in there that you'd like to tackle, please feel free to do so. I would ask that when fixing a bug, that you first create a failing test that proves the bug. Then to fix the bug, make the test pass. This should hopefully ensure that the bug never creeps into the project again. After you've done all that, you can [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chill117/express-mysql-session/pulls/new) with your changes.\n\nBefore you contribute code, please read through at least some of the source code for the project. I would appreciate it if any pull requests for source code changes follow the coding style of the rest of the project.\n\nNow if you're still interested, you'll need to get your local environment configured.\n\n\n### Configure Local Environment\n\n#### Step 1: Get the Code\n\nFirst, you'll need to pull down the code from GitHub:\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:chill117/express-mysql-session.git\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nSecond, you'll need to install the project dependencies as well as the dev dependencies. To do this, simply run the following from the directory you created in step 1:\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Set Up the Test Database\n\nNow, you'll need to set up a local test database:\n```js\n{\n\thost: 'localhost',\n\tport: 3306,\n\tuser: 'session_test',\n\tpassword: 'password',\n\tdatabase: 'session_test'\n}\n```\n*These database credentials are located at `test/config/database.js`*\n\n\n### Running Tests\n\nWith your local environment configured, running tests is as simple as:\n```\nnpm test\n```",
